# mysql-database-performance-optimization
This project focuses on identifying and optimizing slow-running SQL queries using MySQL and the Sakila sample database.  A slow query was analyzed using EXPLAIN, rewritten to remove non-SARGable conditions, and optimized using indexing.  Performance improvements were validated using execution plans before and after optimization.
